This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Windows-MCP is a Python MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that bridges AI LLM agents with the Windows OS, enabling direct desktop automation. It exposes 22 tools via FastMCP:

| Group | Tools |
|---|---|
| Capture | `Screenshot`, `Snapshot`, `Scrape`, `DisplayInventory` |
| Input | `Click`, `Type`, `Scroll`, `Move` (also drag-and-drop via `drag=True`), `Shortcut`, `MultiSelect`, `MultiEdit`, `RunBatch` |
| Timing | `Wait`, `WaitFor`, `CancelBatch` |
| System | `App`, `PowerShell`, `FileSystem`, `Registry`, `Process`, `Clipboard`, `Notification` |

Tool names are defined by the `name=` argument of each `@mcp.tool(...)` in `src/windows_mcp/tools/`; that directory is the source of truth. Note the shell tool is registered as `PowerShell`, not `Shell`. Any subset can be enabled at startup with `--tools`, or removed with `--exclude-tools` (for example, `--tools Screenshot,Snapshot,RunBatch,CancelBatch` or `--exclude-tools PowerShell,Registry`).

```

**Package manager**: UV (not pip). **Python**: 3.14+ (see `pyproject.toml` and `.python-version`). **Build backend**: setuptools.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a layered service architecture under `src/windows_mcp/`:

**Entry point** — `__main__.py`: Builds the FastMCP server, parses CLI flags, and selects the transport. Tool registration is delegated to `tools.register_all()`; an async lifespan initializes the Desktop, WatchDog, and Analytics singletons, which tools resolve lazily through the `get_desktop` / `get_analytics` callables.

**Tools layer** — `tools/`: One module per tool group, each exposing `register(mcp, *, get_desktop, get_analytics)`. `tools/__init__.py` holds the module list and `register_all()`. Tool functions are thin — they normalize arguments and delegate to a service package. The `@with_analytics` decorator wraps each one for telemetry, making it the existing precedent for cross-cutting concerns at the tool boundary.

**Desktop service** — `desktop/service.py`: High-level orchestrator. Manages window operations (launch, resize, switch), screenshots, mouse/keyboard actions, and clipboard. Interfaces with Tree service for UI element discovery. `desktop/views.py` defines data models: `DesktopState`, `Window`, `Size`, `BoundingBox`, `Status`.

**Batch execution** — `tools/batch.py`: `RunBatch` validates action-specific schemas inside the tool so invalid typed text is not reflected by wire validation, resolves Snapshot-bound targets, holds the desktop interaction lease across serial input steps, and evaluates local waits and verification predicates. Foreground checks use live raw/root HWND, PID, title, and process identity; the base `_AutomationClient` is thread-local to its COM apartment. `CancelBatch` requests cooperative cancellation by `execution_id`. Native calls already in progress cannot be forcibly interrupted, and batches do not roll back. The Chinese [implementation and acceptance guide](docs/low-latency-computer-use.zh.md) describes the supported interface and remaining integration work.

**Tree service** — `tree/service.py`: Captures the Windows accessibility tree from active and background windows. Identifies interactive elements and scrollable areas. Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for multi-threaded UI traversal. `tree/views.py` defines `TreeElementNode`, `ScrollElementNode`, `TreeState`. `tree/config.py` has control type configurations.

**UIAutomation wrapper** — `uia/`: Low-level abstraction over the Windows UIAutomation COM API via `comtypes`. `core.py` wraps the main automation object, `controls.py` has control-specific logic, `patterns.py` wraps UIAutomation patterns, `enums.py` has COM enumerations, `events.py` handles event subscriptions.

**WatchDog** — `watchdog/service.py`: Runs in a separate thread monitoring UI focus changes via UIAutomation events. Notifies the Tree service of focus changes so the accessibility tree stays current.

**Virtual Desktop Manager** — `vdm/core.py`: Tracks which windows belong to which Windows virtual desktop (Win10/11).

**Domain services** — thin packages backing the system tools: `filesystem/` (read/write/copy/move/delete/list/search/info), `registry/` (get/set/delete/list, implemented via PowerShell cmdlets), `powershell/` (`PowerShellExecutor` plus environment resolution), `process/` (list/kill), `notifications/`. Registry and PowerShell tools shell out, so their latency is dominated by process startup.

**Infrastructure** — `infrastructure/`: cross-cutting concerns. `analytics.py` (optional PostHog telemetry, disabled with `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=false`; records tool names and errors only, never arguments or outputs), `auth.py` and `oauth.py` (bearer-token and OAuth middleware for HTTP transports), `security.py` (SSRF validation, IP allowlist middleware), `config.py` (server configuration). Note `windows_mcp/config.py` at the package root is unrelated — it only holds the `WINDOWS_MCP_DEBUG` helpers.

## Code Style

- Formatter/linter: **Ruff** (line length 100, double quotes)
- Naming: PEP 8 — `snake_case` functions/variables, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_CASE` constants
- Type hints required on function signatures
- Google-style docstrings for public functions/classes

## Key Design Details

- Screenshots are capped to 1920x1080 for token efficiency
- Mouse/keyboard input uses UIA (same coordinate space as BoundingRectangle; no DPI mismatch)
- Screenshot is the preferred fast visual-context tool; Snapshot is the heavier path for UI element ids and DOM extraction
- Browser detection (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) triggers special DOM extraction mode in Snapshot
- Fuzzy string matching (`thefuzz`) is used for element name matching
- UI element fetching has retry logic (`THREAD_MAX_RETRIES=3` in tree service)
- The server supports stdio, SSE, and streamable HTTP transports

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WINDOWS_MCP_SCREENSHOT_SCALE` | `1.0` | Scale factor for screenshots (range `0.1`–`1.0`). Lower on 1440p/4K to stay under Claude Desktop's 1 MB limit. Resolved in `tools/_snapshot_helpers.py`. |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_SCREENSHOT_BACKEND` | `auto` | Screenshot backend: `auto`, `dxcam`, `mss`, `pillow`. Resolved in `desktop/screenshot.py`. |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_MAX_TREE_ELEMENTS` | `500` | Max UI elements a single Snapshot/WaitFor tree capture may collect before it stops descending and returns a truncated tree (with a note in the output). Bounds both traversal time and response size on huge flat lists/grids (e.g. an unfiltered inventory view with thousands of rows). Resolved in `tree/budget.py`. |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_PROFILE_SNAPSHOT` | _(off)_ | Set to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` to log per-stage timing for Screenshot/Snapshot. Checked in `tools/_snapshot_helpers.py` and `desktop/service.py`. |
| `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable PostHog telemetry. Checked in `__main__.py` and `infrastructure/analytics.py`. |
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Project default | Override the PostHog project write key used for anonymous telemetry. Set to an empty string to skip PostHog client initialization. Checked in `infrastructure/analytics.py`. |
| `POSTHOG_HOST` | `https://us.i.posthog.com` | Override the PostHog host for anonymous telemetry, such as for a self-hosted PostHog deployment. Checked in `infrastructure/analytics.py`. |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_WATCHDOG` | _(off)_ | Set to `on`/`1`/`true`/`yes`/`enabled` to start the UIA focus WatchDog thread. Unset, or any other value, leaves it off. Opt-in because it only emits debug logging today but can crash the server via the UIA event pump (#332). Resolved in `__main__.py`. |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_DEBUG` | `false` | Set to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` to enable debug mode. Checked in `config.py`. Also available as `--debug` CLI flag. |
| `WINDOWS_MCP_DISABLE_FLASH` | _(off)_ | Set to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` to suppress the orange-red glowing border that briefly appears after every screenshot. Resolved in `desktop/flash_overlay.py`. |

## Security Context

This server has **full system access** with no sandboxing. `PowerShell`, `FileSystem`, `Registry`, `Process`, and `App` can all perform irreversible operations, and there is no durable audit log or rollback. The recommended deployment target is a VM or Windows Sandbox. Use `--tools` or `--exclude-tools` to drop the tools a given deployment does not need. `RunBatch` accepts UI actions and waits; it excludes direct shell, registry, filesystem, process, application-launch, and nested-batch actions. GUI clicks and keyboard input can still submit forms, delete data, or open terminals. The calling application owns authorization and must split batches before actions that need separate approval.
